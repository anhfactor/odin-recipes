        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine frozen blueberries, sugar, and lemon juice for jam in a small pot over medium heat; bring to a
                simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture has reduced and thickened, about 12 minutes. Remove
                from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>Pour mixture through a fine mesh sieve, pressing solids to extract as much jam as possible; you should
                have approximately 1/4 cup. Discard any solids and refrigerate jam until completely cool, at least 30
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 18 muffin cups with paper liners.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt for cupcakes together in a small bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cream sugar and butter together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Mix in lemon juice, lemon zest,
                and vanilla until combined. Add flour mixture in 2 batches, alternating with buttermilk, beating batter
                just until combined after each addition; batter will be somewhat thick.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place frozen blueberries in a small bowl and toss with flour until coated. Add to the batter and fold to
                incorporate. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each one 3/4 full.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Check to see if a toothpick inserted into the centers comes
                out clean, and continue to bake, if needed, for 4 to 8 more minutes. Cool in the pans for 5 minutes
                before removing to a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>
                While the cupcakes are cooling, remove blueberry jam from the refrigerator. Measure out 1/4 cup for the
                frosting and reserve any extra for another use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat butter for frosting in a large bowl until creamy and smooth. Add 1 cup powdered sugar, lemon zest,
                lemon juice, and salt; beat until thoroughly combined. Add 1/4 cup blueberry jam and mix until combined.
                Add 1 cup powdered sugar and mix until smooth. Repeat with remaining 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar. Add
                heavy cream and beat until frosting is smooth and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes more.
            </li>
            <li>
                Frost cooled cupcakes.
            </li>
